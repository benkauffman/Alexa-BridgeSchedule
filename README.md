# Multnomah Bridges AWS Lambda

## Concepts

This is an Alexa skill that is used to get information about the bridge schedules from the Multnomah County API.

## Example user interactions:
  User:  "Alexa, ask Multnomah Bridges, what is the schedule for the burnside bridge?"
  <br>Alexa: "The next scheduled lift is at 3pm on Monday the 5th of August"


  User:  "Alexa, ask Multnomah Bridges, is the burnside bride up?"
  <br>Alexa: "The burnside bridge is currently down. It has historically been lifted 227 times, with an average lift time of 10.79 minutes."
