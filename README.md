#Bridge Schedule AWS Lambda

## Concepts

This is an Alexa skill that is used to get information about the bridge schedules.
I don't currently have access to the Multnomah County API ... but once I do, I'll hook up real data.

## Example user interactions:
  User:  "Alexa, what is the schedule for the burnside bridge"
  Alexa: "The next scheduled lift is at 3pm on Monday the 5th of August"
